Welcome

Fill in a zipcode

<%= form_for @search do |f| %>
  <%= f.label :zipcode %>:
  <%= f.text_field :zipcode %><br />

  <%= f.submit %>
<% end %>

<!-- this form needs to create a new "search", the important piece being the zipcode,
 the form saves the zip value and uses it/inserts it in the api call
to create a new search, I need some kind of  "create" method
would this happen in a new search controller-->


<!--  do I need a 'form'? can I just get user input to supply the zipcode value for the api call...-->
